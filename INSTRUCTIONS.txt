Requirements:
1. Install Macaulay2 (http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/)
2. Download Boost Library 1.55.0 (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/)
NOTE: If you want to use a different version of the Boost Library, you will have to edit the file NetReductionBoost/Makefile accordingly (Step 3 in Compiling)
3. Download BNReduction.zip
4. Have gcc, g++, perl, bash

Compiling:
1. Unzip BNReduction.zip
2. Move the Boost Library folder to the BNReduction folder
3. Make sure the contents of the file NetReductionBoost/Makefile and your version of the Boost Library match (only necessary if using a different version of Boost Library).
4. Go to BNReduction
5. make clean
6. make install
7. ./Testing_BNReduction.sh (this is used to check that everything is working)

Usage:  
./BNReduction.sh inputfile
The file with steady states will be generated into inputfile.fp (if it has no lines, that means there are no fixed points)
NOTE: The input file must be a file where each line has a Boolean function for each variable. E.g., the following is a Boolean network in 4 variables:
x1 & x2
0
!x2 | x4
1
The variables must range from x1 to xn. The folder Examples has some examples of Boolean networks in the necessary format.
